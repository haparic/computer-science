1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
student lists are placed alphabetically, a teacher might use a linear search to look for students sinc it is too few to do a binary search
2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
playing a game like 21 questions to determine what the person is supposed to be
3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
7
4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
3
5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
a linear search is better for this scenario, binary searches can not work with unsorted collections.
6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
a binary search will be best for sorted collections because it will be able to determine if it needs to go higher or lower and split it in half by value


Programming Assignment:
You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
function search(array, word){
  var left = 0;
  var right = array.length - 1;
  
  while(left <= right) {
    let mid = Math.round((left + right)/2)
    if (array[mid] === word){
      return `${array[mid]} is in position ${mid + 1} of this list.`;
    } else if (array[mid]< word){
      left = mid + 1;
    } else if (array[mid] > word){
      right = mid -1
    } 
  }
  return null
}
  
  var dictionary = ["Ascot", "Albatross", "Amoeba", "Beer","Bubbles", "Caesar", "Chile"];

console.log(search(dictionary, "Albatross"));

You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
function findFish(tank, fish){
    for(let i = 0; i < tank.length; i++) {
      if (tank[i] === fish){
        return fish
      } 
    }
    return null
}

var fishTank =["one fish", "two fish", "red fish", "blue fish", "white-spotted goldfish"];
console.log(findFish(fishTank,"white-spotted goldfish"))

1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?
linked lists do not follow a specific order and cut down on memory because they have nodes.
the nodes contain the information in them and a reference to the node next to it.


2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.
It would be prefferable to use a linked list when looking up a contact. you would not want to begin
at the letter A every time you were searching for someone. it would also require power to reorganize anytime
a new contact was created.

1.
The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is pseudocode 
for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug 
and a functional implementation of the method.

A: The function is trying to set the newly created node as the head node. This would not work because the Head element would be the 
first element that was created. The element would have to go to the end of the list.

FUNCTION push(element)
CREATE node
SET node.value TO element
SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
 THEN SET head to node 
ELSE
 SET current to head
 SET current.next to node
END IF
END FUNCTION

LinkedList.prototype.push = function(val){
  var node = {
    value: val,
    next: null
  }
  if(!this.head){
    this.head = node;
  } 
  else{
    current = this.head;
    while(current.next){
      current.next;
    }
    current.next = node;
  }
}



2.
Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d

function LinkedList () {
    this.head = null;
}

LinkedList.prototype.removeDuplicates = function () {
    if (!this.head || !this.head.next) {
      console.log('No duplicates were found.');
      return;
    }

    var head;
    var nextTo;
    var nodes = {};

    head = this.head;
    nextTo = head.next;
    nodes[head.data] = true;

    while (nextTo) {
        var data = nextTo.data;
        if (nodes[data]) {
            head.next = nextTo.next;
        } else {
            nodes[data] = true;
            head = nextTo;
        }
        nextTo = nextTo.next;
    }
};

var list = new LinkedList();
list.push('a'); 
list.push('a'); 
list.push('b'); 
list.push('c'); 
list.push('c');
list.push('d');
list.push('e');

list.removeDuplicates();
console.log(list)



3.
Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

function reverse(head){
  let previous = null
  let current = head
  let following = head

    while (current !== null){
        following = following.next
        current.next = previous
        previous = current
        current = following
    }
    return previous;
}

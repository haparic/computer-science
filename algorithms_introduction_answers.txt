Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;
Washing dishes;
A choice of your own.

2.
As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a 
situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need
to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search 
engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?


3.
Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.
